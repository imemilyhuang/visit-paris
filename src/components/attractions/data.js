"fun-fact": "Most of the buildings for the care and housing of veterans were completed in five years (1671–76) by the architect Libéral Bruant. However, he had difficulty designing the church that was to serve both the residents and the king. Bruant's nave eventually became the soldiers' chapel (Église des Soldats). At the suggestion of the architect and designer Pierre Fontaine, the nave was draped with enemy banners captured by victorious French armies. The architect Jules Hardouin-Mansart (best known for the Palace of Versailles) was brought in to design the royal chapel, called the Dome Church (Église du Dôme). The dome exterior is wrapped in gold leaf, and the interior is decorated with a fresco by Charles de La Fosse depicting Louis IX (St. Louis) in the act of presenting his sword to Christ. The two chapels were linked by an oval sanctuary open to both. The resulting hybrid church was dedicated to Louis IX, France's most venerated soldier-king."},
